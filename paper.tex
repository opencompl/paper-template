\section{Research Work Conducted}

The primary goals of this Ambizione research project were proposed as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a multi-target heterogeneous compute compiler for C++ and Julia code that generates binaries which effectively exploit
OpenCL-capable accelerators including GPU, Xeon-Phi, and FPGA.
\item Research new techniques to scale polyhedral optimization to large kernels and to improve their efficiency to a level that permits
the effective exploration of a large set of mapping choices.
\item Derive effective performance models based on hybrid analytical/machine-learning techniques and use them to analyze and optimize accelerator mapping decisions in a large body of existing software.
\item Evolve our new performance modeling techniques to work within the resource constraints of Julias dynamic run-time system and use Julia to experiment with distributed learning techniques.
\end{itemize}

The focus of year three in this Ambizione project was the integration of a scalable
polyhedral core infrastructure into real-world compilers (e.g, LLVM/MLIR),
establishing backends for targetting accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs, and,
finally, developing good performance models. As mentioned in the year 2
report, our focus moved from Julia to MLIR as a compiler and programming
language infrastructure.

In the following, we discuss four milestones we identified as important to
reach these goals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fast, robust, and correct polyhedral libraries
\item Solid polyhedral compiler infrastructure
\begin{itemize}
\item  Modular pattern-based optimizations for CPU and GPU systems
\item 
DeLICM: Scalar dependence removal
\end{itemize}
\item Fast GPU code generation demonstrated via a climate DSL
\item Code Generation for Emerging Architectures and FPGA
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Fast, robust, and correct polyhedral libraries}
Presburger arithmetic provides the mathematical core for the polyhedral
compilation techniques that drive analytical cache models, loop optimization
for ML and HPC, formal verification, and even hardware design.  Polyhedral
compilation is widely regarded as being slow due to the potentially high
computational cost of the underlying Presburger libraries. Researchers
typically use these libraries as powerful black-box tools, but a lack of
internal documentation and decade-old C implementations hold back broader
performance-optimization efforts. With FPL, we introduced a new library for
Presburger arithmetic for the MLIR compiler built from the ground up in modern
C++. We carefully documented its internal algorithmic foundations, use
lightweight C++ data structures to minimize memory management costs, and deployed
transprecision computing across the entire library to effectively exploit
machine integers and vector instructions. On a newly-developed comprehensive
benchmark suite for Presburger arithmetic, we show a 5.25x speedup in total
runtime over the state-of-the-art library isl in its default configuration and
3.14x when over a variant of isl optimized with element-wise transprecision
computing. We expect that the availability of a well-documented and fast
Presburger library will accelerate the adoption of polyhedral compilation
techniques in production compilers.

The central components of this library have already been upstreamed into the
open-source LLVM/MLIR project and are usable by the wider research and 
industrial community. The work in this subproject has been published in \citet{grosser2020fast} and
\citet{pichanatan2021}.

\subsection{Fast GPU code generation demonstrated via a climate DSL}

Most compilers have a single core intermediate representation (IR) (e.g., LLVM)
sometimes complemented with vaguely-defined IR-like data structures. This IR is
commonly low-level and close to machine instructions. As a result,
optimizations relying on domain-specific information are either not possible or
require complex analysis to recover the missing information. In contrast,
multi-level rewriting instantiates a hierarchy of dialects (IRs), lowers
programs level-by-level, and performs code transformations at the most suitable
level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for the weather and
climate domain. In particular, we develop a prototype compiler and design
stencil- and GPU-specific dialects based on a set of newly introduced design
principles. We find that two domain-specific optimizations (500 lines of code)
realized on top of LLVM’s extensible MLIR compiler infrastructure suffice to
outperform state-of-the-art solutions. In essence, multi-level rewriting
promises to herald the age of specialized compilers composed from domain- and
target-specific dialects implemented on top of a shared infrastructure.

The GPU backend of the open-earth compiler has already been upstreamed into
the open-source LLVM/MLIR project and is useable by the wider research
and industrial community. The work in this subproject has been published in \citet{gysi2020ooc}


\subsection{Code Generation for Emerging Architectures and FPGA}

Automatic optimization for emerging architectures and FPGA has been a principal
objective of this work. We exploited the polyhedral techniques we developed in
earlier tasks to generate high-performance code for emerging memory
architectures such as racetrack memories to optimize polyhedral loop nests and
deep neural networks. We also proposed infrastructure for an open-source
hardware stack that allows for the compilation and simulation of System Verilog
code. We also observed an increased use of systems with where the data models
(e.g., pointer sizes) differ between host systems and accelerators. To ensure
the automatic code generation for such architectures that also allows for
automatic data movement, we expanded LLVM and its OpenMP software stack to
support mixed-data-model offloading.

The LLHD compiler has been upstreamed as open-source into the LLVM/CIRCT
project. The work in this subproject has been published in \citet{khan2020polyhedral},
\citet{schueki2020llhd}, \citet{kurth2020mixed}, and \citet{kourtis2020compiling}.
