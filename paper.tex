\section{Introduction}

Of this super cool article \ldots
\grosser{A simple comment refering to a particular location}

If there is \authorTwo[some text we want to refer to specifically]{this looks
particularly interesting} we can refer to this text from within our comments.

And here we only mark \authorTwo[text]{} that is \authorTwo[interesting]{}, but do not
actually comment.

Now we have a sequence of comments,
\authorThree{Comment 3}
\authorFour{Comment 4}
\authorFive{Comment 5}
\authorSix{Comment 6}
which should not introduce overlong white space sequences.

Sometimes it is also important to \emph{emphasize} text to understand if it is
underlined or printed in italic.

We sometimes use macros to state that a tool as the name \toolname{} in a
flexible way.

\section{Formatting and Writing Guidelines}

These formatting guidelines aim to standardize our writing. They ensure that
papers with multiple authors have a consistent look and that commonly occurring
items are formatted in ways that are known to work well.

\subsection{Figures}

\paragraph{Referencing Figures} When referencing figures from the text we
ensure the following:
\begin{description}
      \item [All figures are referenced] A paper with un-referenced figures
	      appears incomplete.
      \item [References to figures are brief and easy to skip]~\\
                We minimize the number of words needed to refer to a figure. Reducing
                the number of non-information-carrying words directly increases
		the density of interesting content. When skipping references
		becomes easy, reading quickly while ignoring figures remains a
		smooth experience. The best and briefest reference to a figure
		is a link in parenthesis that is added after the subject
		representing the content depicted in a figure:\\
		{\color{pairedTwoDarkBlue}\textit{Figure
		X shows the design of A, which consists of ...}}\\
		$\to$ {\color{pairedFourDarkGreen}
		\textit{The design of A (Figure X) consists of ...}}
      \item [The text is always self-contained without figures] ~\\ The reader
                should be able to read the text without ever looking at any
                figure. They should still understand the text and get the key
		message of each figure directly from the text. By not forcing
		the reader to analyze a figure while reading, we increase
		readability as the reader can continue reading without having
		to skip between text and figures. Such writing style also helps
		to guide the thoughts of the reader, who can (for a moment)
		trust our summary of the figure and does not need to develop
		their own interpretation on-the-fly, a task which often yields
		results that do not fit the flow of our exposition. Readers
		typically only feel that their reading is interrupted if there
		is no explanation of a figure at all. Hence, we do not need to
		discuss all details of a figure, but half a sentence that explains the
		core idea is typically sufficient for a reader to continue
		reading.  By making
		our text self-contained even when ignoring figures the reader
		experiences a smooth and uninterrupted reading experience.\\
		{\color{pairedTwoDarkBlue}
		\textit{The speedups are presented in Figure X. < a new topic> }}\\
		$\to$ {\color{pairedFourDarkGreen}\textit{Our approach outperforms the state of the art
		XXX-library (Figure 3) demonstrating more than 4x speedup on
		test case 1 and 2 and a geometric mean speedup of 1.5x over all
		20 test cases.}}
\end{description}
We reference figures in text using
\texttt{\symbol{92}autoref\{fig:speedup\}} for a figure with label
\texttt{fig:speedup}.  The use of autoref ensures that all references
to figures are formatted consistently, e.g. as \autoref{fig:speedup}.

\paragraph{Color Scheme} 

In Figures we use a color scheme that is print-friendly and also visible
with red-green blindness. The following colors are all print-friendly
and red-green save when only using Color 1-4:

\medskip
{
	\small
\newcolumntype{a}{>{\columncolor{pairedOneLightBlue}}c}
\newcolumntype{b}{>{\columncolor{pairedTwoDarkBlue}}c}
\newcolumntype{d}{>{\columncolor{pairedThreeLightGreen}}c}
\newcolumntype{e}{>{\columncolor{pairedFourDarkGreen}}c}
\newcolumntype{f}{>{\columncolor{pairedFiveLightRed}}c}
\newcolumntype{g}{>{\columncolor{pairedSixDarkRed}}c}

\begin{tabular}{a b d e f g}
Color 1 & Color 2 & Color 3 & Color 4 & Color 5 & Color 6\\
\#a6cee3 & \#1f78b4 & \#b2df8a & \#33a02c & \#fb9a99 & \#e31a1c
\end{tabular}
}

We de-emphasize components in figures by using additionally two shades of gray.
Especially in complex figures, it is often helpful to de-emphasize visual
elements that we want to represent but that should not be the focus of a
reader's attention.

\medskip
{
	\small
\newcolumntype{h}{>{\columncolor{pairedNegOneLightGray}}c}
\newcolumntype{i}{>{\columncolor{pairedNegTwoDarkGray}}c}

\begin{tabular}{h i}
Color -1 & Color -2\\
\#cacaca & \#827b7b\\
\end{tabular}
}

Single-color graphs are plotted in Color 1 - Light Blue.

\paragraph{Labels in Figures}
Complex diagrams often benefit from labels inside the diagrams. We suggest to
use a filled circle (e.g, in light blue) to highlight these numbers and use
these references, e.g., \circled{1} implemented as \texttt{\textbackslash{}circled\{1\}}, in the text to refer to them.

\subsubsection{Plots} We use matplotlib to create performance
plots such as \autoref{fig:speedup}. We use the following
formatting guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use a vertical y-label to make it easier to read.
  \item Remove top and right frames to reduce visual noise
	and allow the reader to focus on the data in the
	figure.
  \item Provide the concrete data at the top of each bar.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We also suggest to follow these technical remarks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create pdf plots and do not use bitmap formats (e.g., png) to
	ensure high quality when zooming in.
  \item Avoid Type-3 bitmap fonts by
	setting fonttype to 42.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plots/speedup}
\caption{Improved running speed after 4 weeks of training.
}
\label{fig:speedup}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables} We optimize our tables for readability by removing as
much clutter as possible, while highlighting the key structure. Markus Püschel
(see doc/paper-writing/guide-tables.pdf) wrote a nice guide on how to make nice
tables. \autoref{tab:simple_table} illustrates this with a simple
table.

\begin{table}
\ra{1.2}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l r}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Animal} & \textbf{Size} & \textbf{Biotope} & \textbf{Age}\\
  \midrule
  Dog & Medium & Ground & 20\\
  Cat & Medium & Ground &20 \\
  Ant & Small & Ground & 30 \\
  Elephant & Large & Ground & 70\\
  Whale & Large & Water & 100\\
  Salmon & Medium & Water & 13 \\
  Eagle & Large & Air & 35 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}
\caption{A table with heigh lines and emphasized header.}
\label{tab:simple_table}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Listings} We aim to use minted to create listings as much as
possible, as this allows us to edit code quickly. We use syntax highlighting
to make the parts of the code that matter most stand out. Hence, we keep
most code black, comments gray, and highlight just the MLIR operands that
we care about most.

\begin{listing}[H]
% We cannot put '{' on a line after % in draftonly mode, as the hack we used to
% not include the draft section will interpret the listing as normal
% latex where '%' is a comment and {} need to match, which they will
% not if only one is commented.
\begin{mlir}
// This is a comment
def @foo(%0 : !dialect.type)
{
  %a = dialect.op(%0) : !dialect.type // $\color{black}\circled{a}$
}
\end{mlir}
\caption{A simple MLIR code example with markers. Markers can also be placed in
	captions and refer to labels, e.g. \circled[lst:example]{a}.}
\label{lst:example}
\end{listing}

The syntax highlighting also works for xDSL-like IRs. Notice that different
minted styles can be used for different environments. The xDSL environment uses
the murphy-style in this case, whereas the MLIR version applies the
colorful-style.

\begin{xdsl}
func.func() [sym_name = "main", function_type = !fun<[
              !iterators.columnar_batch<!tuple<[!i64]>>
                 ], []>] {
  ^bb0(%0 : !iterators.columnar_batch<!tuple<[!i64]>>):
    %t : !iterators.stream<!llvm.struct<[!i64]>> =
      iterators.scan_columnar_batch(%0 : ...)
    %filtered : !iterators.stream<!llvm.struct<[!i64]>> =
          iterators.filter(%input : …) [predicateRef = @s0]
    iterators.sink(%filtered : !iterators.stream<!tuple<[!i64]>>)
    func.return()
}

func.func() [sym_name = "s0", function_type = !fun<[
    !llvm.struct<[!i64]>], [!i1]>] {
  ^bb0(%struct : !llvm.struct<[!i64]>):
    %id : !i64 = llvm.extractvalue(%struct : ...)
              [position = [0 : !index]]
    %five  : !i64 = arith.constant() [value = 5 : !i64]
    %cmp : !i1 = arith.cmpi(%id : !i64, %five : !i64)
              [predicate = 4 : !i64]
    func.return(%cmp : !i1)
}
\end{xdsl}


\end{draftonly}
