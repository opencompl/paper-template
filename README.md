This repository serves as a template for writing computer science papers in LaTeX. It supports
the following features:

- Automatic paper builds using GitHub Actions
- Normal and Draft variants of the same paper
- Automatically generate a source archive of the paper
    By running `create-source-archive.sh` a file `paper-source.zip` is
    generated that contains the paper latex sources.
- Comments
  - Notes are in the margin to not change the length of the paper
  - Wide margins (that do not change the paper layout) to have plenty
      of room for comments
  - Pieces of text can be addressed specifically by underlining this text
  - Comments in float enviroments (e.g., figure)

To periodically update your paper with the latest template changes after cloning this repository, you can run the 
following commands:

```bash
# add upstream (only required once)
git remote add upstream git@github.com:opencompl/paper-template.git
# or
git remote add upstream https://github.com/opencompl/paper-template.git

# periodically update
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

# Notes

- For `minted` version 3, users are required to add the following to their `${HOME}` or `TEXMFHOME` directory in a file
  named `.latexminted_config`:

  ```json
  {
    "security": {
      "enable_cwd_config": true
    }
  }
  ```

  This is due to the fact that `minted` restricts shell execution of custom lexers by default for security reasons
  (i.e., arbitrary code execution).

  Moreover, the `minted` package requires each custom lexer to be listed by name and associated with its SHA256 hash of
  its containing file in a `.latexminted_config` file at the top of the paper template directory. We provide this
  configuration, and a way to update it upon updating/adding the lexers by running the following command:

  ```bash
  tools/generate_lexers_json.py
  ```
